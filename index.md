# Staff Guide

Welcome to the Scions of Silverymoon Staff Guide.

This guide provides comprehensive rules and guidelines for staff members managing Scions of Silverymoon.

---

## Staff Conduct

As a staff member, you are expected to uphold the highest standards of behavior:

- **Lead by example** - Follow the rules and guide others to doing so if it seems they may need a gentle reminder.
- **Speak with intent and empathy** - Operate in good faith, and when addressing anyone (including other staff) try to be diplomatic whenever possible.
- **No bigotry** - We do not tolerate explicit hate toward any group based on race, gender, religion, or LGBT+ status. Stop it or report it when you see it.
- **Address hateful and inappropriate content swiftly** - Explicit pictures and posts can be taken down via any staff, or communicated to @Mods for support.

These short points are the baseline for how staff should act. For role-specific expectations, see the [Staff Roles]({{ '/guides/staff-roles.html' | relative_url }}) guide.
