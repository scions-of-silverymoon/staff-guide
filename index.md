# Staff Guide

Welcome to the Scions of Silverymoon Staff Guide.

This guide provides comprehensive rules and guidelines for staff members managing Scions of Silverymoon.

## Staff conduct 

- Lead by example. Follow the rules and guide others to doing so if it seems they made need a gentle reminder.
- Speak with intent and empathy. Operate in good faith, and when addressing anyone - including other staff - try to be diplomatic whenever possible.
- No bigotry. We do not tolerate explicit hate toward any group based on race, gender, religion or LGBT+ status. Stop it or report it when you see it.
- Address hateful and inappropriate content swiftly. Explicit pictures and posts can be taken down via any staff ask or communicated to @Mods for support.


These short points are the baseline for how staff should act. For role-specific expectations, see the Staff Roles section below.
