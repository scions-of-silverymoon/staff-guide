## Availability & Expectations

This section explains how availability is tracked and what to do if you need to step away.

### Availability rules

- Helpers: availability is measured bi-weekly. If you'll be unavailable for more than two weeks, notify [@Mods]({{ '/guides/moderation.html' | relative_url }}).
- NPCs: try to be available for at least one scene per month to be considered active.
- DMs: if you haven't run a game within two months, staff may check in about future plans.

### Inactivity and stepping down

- After a month of complete inactivity and no communication, Mods will attempt to contact you. No response may lead to removal from staff.
- If you need to step down temporarily, communicate with a Mod. Options include being kept as `@Staff` or stepping down fully.
- There is no punishment for asking to step down — communicate your needs.

### Leaving for emergencies

- If you must leave for an emergency, give as much notice as possible, notify Mods, and let any RP partners know.
