Overview

Staff keep the community running. In general:

- Lead by example and follow the rules.
- Speak with intent and empathy; operate in good faith.
- Address hateful or inappropriate content quickly and escalate as needed.

Who does what (short summaries)

- Helpers: the boots-on-the-ground staff. They welcome new players, answer questions, and route issues to the right staff.
- Moderators (Mods) and Admins: handle enforcement, server settings, escalations, and major decisions.
- DMs: plan and run games, handle bounties/missions, and work with Game Keepers for rewards.
- Game Keeper: maintains game/reward systems and approves submitted game content.
- Event Planners: plan and run server-wide events and coordinate staff for those events.
- Wish System: Wish DMs run Wish games; Wish Keepers manage queue and assignments.
- NPCs: perform NPC interactions and roleplay for players when requested.
- Dragonspeaker: technical staff who maintain code, help fix issues, and implement automation.

Support and escalation

- If you are unsure who to contact, ask in the staff channel and ping `@Mods` or `@admin` depending on severity.
- Escalate repeated or serious issues to Admins/Mods.
