Overview

Staff keep the community running. In general:

- Lead by example and follow the rules.
- Speak with intent and empathy; operate in good faith.
- Address hateful or inappropriate content quickly and escalate as needed.

Support and escalation

- If you are unsure who to contact, ask in the staff channel and ping [@Mods]({{ '/guides/moderation.html' | relative_url }}) or [@admin]({{ '/guides/moderation.html' | relative_url }}) depending on severity.
- Escalate repeated or serious issues to Admins/Mods.
