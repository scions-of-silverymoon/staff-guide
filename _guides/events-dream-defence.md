# Event: Dream Defence

A quick-start for running Dream Defence games.

## Prep (a few days to a week in advance)
## Prep (a few days to a week in advance)
- Tag [@Game Keeper]({{ '/guides/game-keeper.html' | relative_url }}) in [📆game-reserve](https://discord.com/channels/866376531995918346/866474215889043476) with planned date(s), Live or PbP (PbP has a hard cutoff after 2 weeks), tiers of play, and buddy info
- After approval, post your sesh(es):
  - Title: “Sleeping Sickness Dream Defence”
  - Channel: [🎪live-games](https://discord.com/channels/866376531995918346/885356489961775164) or [🤺play-by-post-games](https://discord.com/channels/866376531995918346/885162685505863701)
  - Other fields per the general DM instructions
  - Note the hard PbP cutoff in the description; any level players can sign up and the DM will pick from signups

## Setup and running
- If players are in another PbP, have them run `!savepoint` in that PbP’s dice channel and inform that DM
- A city watch member stands by enchanted mirrors used to enter the dream world
- Use Captain Aisling Underwood as your NPC; you may substitute or minimize NPCs
- If a player dies, they’re ejected back through the mirror without lasting harm
- Consumables and class features work normally in the dream world

## Quick encounter building
- Choose 3–5 players reasonably grouped and pick an appropriate difficulty tier
-- Run `!encounter <tier>` (e.g., `!encounter 3`) in [🤖dm-bot-spam](https://discord.com/channels/866376531995918346/866473838874329094) to generate monsters, tokens, stat blocks, and maps
-- You may adjust outcomes, but use Monster Manual monsters only; ask in [🏹game-discussion](https://discord.com/channels/866376531995918346/922250381197717555) for a sanity check
  - Ping [@Tracker Helper]({{ '/guides/helpers.html' | relative_url }}) with your player selection

## Rewards (Dream Defence)
- [Use the dedicated sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JubFamIuVg73kIUyeA9Fc9LzsLXI-T6prieBJcB0aE8/edit?usp=sharing) (make a copy)
- XP is awarded for monsters killed by the party only; if a player dies during the encounter, they receive 1/2 XP
- Gold is per encounter (not per monster); full gold even if you die
- No item rewards for this event — just gold and XP
