# Event: Dream Defence

A quick-start for running Dream Defence games.

## Prep (a few days to a week in advance)
- Tag @Game Keeper in 📆game-reserve with planned date(s), Live or PbP (PbP has a hard cutoff after 2 weeks), tiers of play, and buddy info
- After approval, post your sesh(es):
  - Title: “Sleeping Sickness Dream Defence”
  - Channel: 🎪live-games or 🤺play-by-post-games
  - Other fields per the general DM instructions
  - Note the hard PbP cutoff in the description; any level players can sign up and the DM will pick from signups

## Setup and running
- If players are in another PbP, have them run `!savepoint` in that PbP’s dice channel and inform that DM
- A city watch member stands by enchanted mirrors used to enter the dream world
- Use Captain Aisling Underwood as your NPC; you may substitute or minimize NPCs
- If a player dies, they’re ejected back through the mirror without lasting harm
- Consumables and class features work normally in the dream world

## Quick encounter building
- Choose 3–5 players reasonably grouped and pick an appropriate difficulty tier
- Run `!encounter <tier>` (e.g., `!encounter 3`) in 🤖dm-bot-spam to generate monsters, tokens, stat blocks, and maps
- You may adjust outcomes, but use Monster Manual monsters only; ask in 🏹game-discussion for a sanity check
- Ping @Tracker Helper with your player selection

## Rewards (Dream Defence)
- Use the dedicated sheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JubFamIuVg73kIUyeA9Fc9LzsLXI-T6prieBJcB0aE8/edit?usp=sharing (make a copy)
- XP is awarded for monsters killed by the party only; if a player dies during the encounter, they receive 1/2 XP
- Gold is per encounter (not per monster); full gold even if you die
- No item rewards for this event — just gold and XP
- Get approval in 💎rewards-discussion (link or screenshot), then log in 📈game-reward-log
