# Encounterer Games (SPECIAL)

## Game Prep - a few days to a week in advance

- Tag **[Game Keeper]({{ '/guides/game-keeper.html' | relative_url }})** in [📆game-reserve](https://discord.com/channels/866376531995918346/866474215889043476):
  - Date(s) planned (you may post multiple at once)
  - Live or PbP (if PbP, hard cut off after 2 weeks, no long games)
  - Tiers of play (signups are open to a wide range of players and then DMs pick a party that makes sense; if you aren't comfortable DMing high levels, that's absolutely okay)
  - If you're bringing a buddy / if you'd like to request a buddy
- Once you've got the all clear (if you haven't within 24hr, ping again), post your sesh(es):
  - Title - Sleeping Sickness Dream Defence
  - Channel - [🎪live-games](https://discord.com/channels/866376531995918346/885356489961775164) or [🤺play-by-post-games](https://discord.com/channels/866376531995918346/885162685505863701)
  - Other fields as per [DM Guide]({{ '/guides/dm-info.html' | relative_url }}) general instructions
  - Description - make sure to note the hard cut off if you're running PbP, and that a wide range / any level players can sign up and DM will pick from the selection
- When you pick players, choose 3-5 that are reasonably grouped together and choose a difficulty tier that suits. Run `!encounter <tier>` eg `!encounter 3` in [🤖dm-bot-spam](https://discord.com/channels/866376531995918346/866473838874329094) to get your monsters, tokens, stat blocks and maps; you may adjust the outcome if you like but Monster Manual monsters only please. Take to [🏹game-discussion](https://discord.com/channels/866376531995918346/922250381197717555) if you want a second pair of eyes.
  - Ping **[Tracker Helper]({{ '/guides/helpers.html' | relative_url }})** with your player selection
  - Gogo! :salute:

## Running the game

- If your players are signing up for a live while in another PbP game, make sure they run `!savepoint` in that PbP game's dice channel and inform that DM (must run in the channel that is being paused, not in your dice channel)
- For your setup, a member of the city watch is standing by the enchanted mirrors Silverymoon is using to break into the dream world.
- Use Captain Aisling Underwood as your NPC; if you specifically would like a different one, you may, and if you'd rather have minimal NPC interaction and just have the players dive through the mirror, also grand.
- If a player dies, they are kicked out of the dream world and tumble back through the mirror; they do not suffer harm
- Any consumables used in the Dream World are still used as per normal, and summoning and class features etc work normally in the dream world

## Rewards

- We have a separate rewards sheet! Use: [Rewards Calculator: Encounterer](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JubFamIuVg73kIUyeA9Fc9LzsLXI-T6prieBJcB0aE8/edit?usp=sharing) - Make a copy, do not edit our master copy
- XP is awarded for monsters killed by party only
- If a player dies during the encounter, they get 1/2 xp
- Gold is per encounter, not per monster, and you still get full gold even if you die
- No items! Just gold and XP for these short games
- Ping **[Game Keeper]({{ '/guides/game-keeper.html' | relative_url }})** in [💎rewards-discussion](https://discord.com/channels/866376531995918346/969652807940603904) with a link and/or screenshot of your sheet to get approval before giving rewards to players at the table
