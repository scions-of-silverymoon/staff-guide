# Wyrmlings (Apprentice Dragonspeakers)

Wyrmlings are members who want to learn and assist with the technical side but are not yet full Dragonspeakers. This is an apprenticeship-style role.

## Responsibilities

- Learn by assisting Dragonspeakers with small tasks and fixes
- Work on supervised, low-risk tasks:
  - Bug fixes
  - Small helper scripts
  - Documentation updates

---

## Pathway to Dragonspeaker

- Wyrmlings who demonstrate reliability, understanding of the codebase, and good communication may be invited to take on more responsibility
- Major responsibility increases require Mod approval

---

## Getting Involved

If you are interested in becoming a Wyrmling or have questions about the Dragonspeaker role, contact a current Dragonspeaker or a Mod.
