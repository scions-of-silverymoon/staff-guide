# DM Info

A practical guide for Dungeon Masters: plan your game, get it approved, post the sesh, pick players, run the table, and award rewards. This page consolidates our current process and links to the tools you need.

- Quick links:
  - Game Reserve: post your submissions in 📆game-reserve and ping @Game Keeper
  - Encounter builders: 🏁encounters-n-maps
  - Game discussion: 🏹game-discussion
  - Rewards discussion/approval: 💎rewards-discussion
  - Reward log: 📈game-reward-log

## 8 simple steps

### 1) Establish details (planning)

Have these basics ready before you post in 📆game-reserve:
- A problem to solve and why PCs hear about it
- At least one NPC or method to brief/payout the party
- Encounters (combat, puzzles, traps, or social) sized for the expected party
- Desired runtime and accepted PC levels

Helpful notes:
- Wish DMs: consider fulfilling a near-queue wish from 📬wish-vault; coordinate with @Wish Keepers and watch 🧨check-the-queue.
- Get feedback from other DMs and @Game Keeper in 🏹game-discussion.
- Encounter tools are in 🏁encounters-n-maps. The Game Rewards Sheet V2 helps with non-combat DCs/definitions:
  - Game Rewards: Now More Rewarding Than Ever (V2): https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11-tEu7aInmTZRz0FF18_-BlGuEYplBjzW8V7ZSsuwqA/edit?usp=sharing

### 2) Submit your game (approval)

Post your details to 📆game-reserve and ping @Game Keeper for approval.
- Please submit no more than 2 weeks in advance.
- When approved, @Tracker Helper will add it to the tracker (your Game Keeper will ping them).

### 3) Post your sesh (Sesh dashboard)

Open: https://sesh.fyi/dashboard/866376531995918346 and fill:
- Event Title: the name of your game
- Start Time: in your timezone; Sesh converts for players
- Channel: 🎉events, 🎪live-games, or 🤺play-by-post-games
- Duration: estimated for live games only (PbP only games shouldn’t use this)
- Mentions: use @Member on the initial post (do NOT @Member on game start); for Wish quests with pre-selected parties, do not ping @Member
- Description: include the format below
- Image: optional; provide a hosted image URL
- RSVP options: leave default (Yes reaction only)

You can edit a Sesh after publishing via the gear icon, until the game begins.

Sesh description template (copy/paste):

```
**Short game hook here**
**Levels:** level range accepted (i.e. levels 4-6, or all levels, etc)
**Number of Players:** # of players (i.e. 4-6 players)
**Game Type:** Live or Traditional play by post; Event, Bounty or Mission. (If live mission, how many sessions)
**Map**: What VTT/map (Owlbear, Avrae, etc) and if it uses voicechat
**Length Anticipated:** Number of hours or days anticipated. Be generous.
**Pace Anticipated:** Once every day or two is standard for PBP; once every 10 minutes as needed is standard for Lives!
**Selection Date:** Give date when players will be chosen by.
```

### 4) Game prep (recommended)

- Set up maps and tokens ahead of time: Avrae maps (http://docs.otfbm.com/#/), Owlbear (https://owlbear.rodeo/how-to), or your VTT of choice
- Test maps and enemies in 🤺combat-testing (ask staff to help test if needed)
- Pre-write non-branching NPC narration and scene descriptions, especially for live games
- Ask @NPC staff for help if you want NPC involvement

### 5) Player selection

On or before your selection date, determine who’s eligible:
- Have they roleplayed or been active recently? High risk to pick players with zero activity
- Use the Character Tracker; prefer players who haven’t had recent games
- Consider party comp for your encounters
- Consider 🎎little-wishes fulfillment opportunities

When ready, ping @Tracker Helper in 🏹game-discussion with your chosen party for an ‘okay’. They’ll update the tracker if all is well.

### 6) Announce selection & table roles

In 📞quest-ooc:
- Tag the chosen players and your game’s OOC (e.g., 🐡bjursta-ooc)
- Provide check-in requirements (vsheets, spellbooks, tokens) and a deadline before start
- Note if you’re opening early for RP before start time
- Name 2 backup players in case of no-shows/cancellations

Follow 🏹quest for no-shows and replacements. If players drop mid-game, see the Rewards section below.

### 7) Rewards

There are three reward types: XP, gold, and items. Use these Silverymoon resources:
- Game Rewards v2 (main): https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qQuZqQSWkRD0ZtGRdJnBLADZQYHy8fLDN7rzlvypOI4/edit?usp=sharing
- Magic Item List: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DG6X1goC2eZi6MtI1F_i4Id5myH6bMa2CCCvOzXTpn0/edit#gid=1800875520

Basics:
- XP is granted for Combat and Non‑Combat encounters by level; for Combat, use an encounter calculator (see 🏁encounters-n-maps) to determine fight difficulty
- Use the Rewards Calculator (copy the sheet) to input encounters and monsters; it calculates XP/gold automatically; items reduce gold to balance
- Reward tiers, by party level at mission completion:
  - Tier 1 (Lvl 4): up to Common, Minor Uncommon
  - Tier 2 (Lvl 5‑6): up to Major Uncommon, Minor Rare
  - Tier 3 (Lvl 7‑10): up to Major Rare, Minor Very Rare
  - Tier 4 (Lvl 11‑14): up to Major Very Rare, Minor Legendary
  - Tier 5 (Lvl 15+): any rarity
- Ask questions in 💎rewards-discussion and tag @Game Keeper for approval; @Tracker Helper will update the tracker after approval

Early Leavers:
- If a player must leave early but contributed significantly, use the “Early Leavers” checkbox in the sheet and explain in Reason
- Mark which encounters each party member attended; Early Leavers don’t receive item rewards but can receive gold and XP for participated encounters
- Adjust encounter difficulty going forward if needed; ask Game Keepers/Mods for help

Varied Item Rewards:
- For higher-level tables, you may offer options across different rarity tiers (per the sheet’s gold equivalence)
- Offer the same tiers to all players; remind them they can replace an existing item in that tier if duplicates aren’t allowed

DM Rewards:
- You may take DM rewards equal to players’ XP and gold, if you wish

### 8) DM responsibilities (pace, communication, autonomy)

- Pacing & communication: baseline is 1 post/day out of initiative, and 1 post/12 hours in combat; align expectations in your sesh post and at the table, and keep the group accountable; ask @Game Keeper or @Mods if pacing/ghosting issues arise
- Character autonomy: don’t dictate player character knowledge or actions; check in before assuming familiarity or feelings; address metagaming directly or via staff
- Game runtime: if a game exceeds the expected timeframe, communicate and adjust; long‑form games should aim for a concrete end date (e.g., “10 weeks”), and shouldn’t pass 60 days beyond that—cut, reorganize, and conclude when needed
