# DM Guide

DMs run games for the community. They plan, submit, and execute bounties, missions, and other game content.

This guide covers your role as a DM and provides practical steps to plan your game, get it approved, post the sesh, pick players, run the table, and award rewards.

---

## DM Responsibilities

- Prep, plan, and submit bounties or missions following server guidelines
- Coordinate player selection and scheduling with other staff
- Run bounties/missions and manage their game channels
- Add and remove roles for their game channels when appropriate
- Report server or player issues that arise during games to staff
- Don't overdo it! 
  - DMs may have two games on deck at a time, whether being played or in game reserve. 
  - We recommend that if you want to run two _at the same time_ then one is a live game or short event.

---

## Best Practices

- Keep clear notes on player agreements, rewards, and any special rules
- Communicate with [@Tracker Helpers]({{ '/guides/helpers.html' | relative_url }}) and [Game Keepers]({{ '/guides/game-keeper.html' | relative_url }}) as needed
- Stay organized with your game timeline and player expectations

## 8 Simple Steps

### 1) Establish Details (Planning)

Have these basics ready before you post in [📆game-reserve](https://discord.com/channels/866376531995918346/866474215889043476):

- A problem to solve and why PCs hear about it
- At least one NPC or method to brief/payout the party
- Encounters (combat, puzzles, traps, or social) sized for the expected party
- Desired runtime and accepted PC levels

**Helpful notes:**
- **Wish DMs**: Consider fulfilling a near-queue wish from [📬wish-vault](https://discord.com/channels/866376531995918346/1088099880318279740); coordinate with [@Wish Keepers]({{ '/guides/wish-system.html' | relative_url }}) and watch [🧨check-the-queue](https://discord.com/channels/866376531995918346/1088099922991120546)
- Get feedback from other DMs and [@Game Keeper]({{ '/guides/game-keeper.html' | relative_url }}) in [🏹game-discussion](https://discord.com/channels/866376531995918346/922250381197717555)
- For calculators, reward sheets, recommended map hosts, and planning tools, see the Game Resources guide: [Game Resources]({{ '/guides/game-resources.html' | relative_url }})

### 2) Submit Your Game (Approval)

Post your details to [📆game-reserve](https://discord.com/channels/866376531995918346/866474215889043476) and ping [@Game Keeper]({{ '/guides/game-keeper.html' | relative_url }}) for approval.
- Please submit no more than 2 weeks in advance.
-- When approved, [@Tracker Helper]({{ '/guides/helpers.html' | relative_url }}) will add it to the tracker (your [@Game Keeper]({{ '/guides/game-keeper.html' | relative_url }}) will ping them).

### 3) Post your sesh (Sesh dashboard)

Open: [The Sesh Dashboard](https://sesh.fyi/dashboard/866376531995918346) and fill:
- Event Title: the name of your game
- Start Time: in your timezone; Sesh converts for players
-- Channel: [🎉events](https://discord.com/channels/866376531995918346/962771936528728134), [🎪live-games](https://discord.com/channels/866376531995918346/885356489961775164), or [🤺play-by-post-games](https://discord.com/channels/866376531995918346/885162685505863701)
-- Duration: estimated for live games only (PbP only games shouldn’t use this)
- Mentions: use @Member on the initial post (do NOT @Member on game start); for Wish quests with pre-selected parties, do not ping @Member
- Description: include the format below
- Image: optional; provide a hosted image URL
- RSVP options: leave default (Yes reaction only)

You can edit a Sesh after publishing via the gear icon, until the game begins.

Sesh description template (copy/paste):

```
**Short game hook here**
**Levels:** level range accepted (i.e. levels 4-6, or all levels, etc)
**Number of Players:** # of players (i.e. 4-6 players)
**Game Type:** Live or Traditional play by post; Event, Bounty or Mission. (If live mission, how many sessions)
**Map**: What VTT/map (Owlbear, Avrae, etc) and if it uses voicechat
**Length Anticipated:** Number of hours or days anticipated. Be generous.
**Pace Anticipated:** Once every day or two is standard for PBP; once every 10 minutes as needed is standard for Lives!
**Selection Date:** Give date when players will be chosen by.
```

### 4) Game prep (recommended)

Set up maps and tokens ahead of time: [Avrae maps](http://docs.otfbm.com/#/), [Owlbear](https://owlbear.rodeo/how-to), or your VTT of choice
 Test maps and enemies in [🤺combat-testing](https://discord.com/channels/866376531995918346/866473073828691988) (ask staff to help test if needed)
Pre-write non-branching NPC narration and scene descriptions, especially for live games
Ask [@NPC staff]({{ '/guides/npcs.html' | relative_url }}) for help if you want NPC involvement

### 5) Player selection

On or before your selection date, determine who’s eligible:
- Have they roleplayed or been active recently? High risk to pick players with zero activity
- Use the Character Tracker; prefer players who haven’t had recent games
- Consider party comp for your encounters
-- Consider [🎎little-wishes](https://discord.com/channels/866376531995918346/1088099833472106547) fulfillment opportunities

When ready, ping [@Tracker Helper]({{ '/guides/helpers.html' | relative_url }}) in [🏹game-discussion](https://discord.com/channels/866376531995918346/922250381197717555) with your chosen party for an ‘okay’. They’ll update the tracker if all is well.

### 6) Announce selection & table roles

In [📞quest-ooc](https://discord.com/channels/866376531995918346/1022191450240327742):
- Tag the chosen players and your game’s OOC (e.g., 🐡bjursta-ooc)
- Provide check-in requirements (vsheets, spellbooks, tokens) and a deadline before start
- Note if you’re opening early for RP before start time
- Name 2 backup players in case of no-shows/cancellations

Follow [🏹quest](https://discord.com/channels/866376531995918346/866515129163055126) for no-shows and replacements. If players drop mid-game, see the Rewards section below.

### 7) Rewards

There are three reward types: XP, gold, and items. Use these Silverymoon resources:
- [Game Rewards Calculator](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qQuZqQSWkRD0ZtGRdJnBLADZQYHy8fLDN7rzlvypOI4/edit?usp=sharing)
- [Magic Item List](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DG6X1goC2eZi6MtI1F_i4Id5myH6bMa2CCCvOzXTpn0/edit#gid=1800875520)

Basics:
- XP is granted for Combat and Non‑Combat encounters by level; for Combat, use an encounter calculator (see [🏁encounters-n-maps](https://discord.com/channels/866376531995918346/866467862540582953)) to determine fight difficulty
- Use the Rewards Calculator (copy the sheet) to input encounters and monsters; it calculates XP/gold automatically; items reduce gold to balance
-- Reward tiers, by party level at mission completion:
  - Tier 1 (Lvl 4): up to Common, Minor Uncommon
  - Tier 2 (Lvl 5‑6): up to Major Uncommon, Minor Rare
  - Tier 3 (Lvl 7‑10): up to Major Rare, Minor Very Rare
  - Tier 4 (Lvl 11‑14): up to Major Very Rare, Minor Legendary
  - Tier 5 (Lvl 15+): any rarity
-- Ask questions in [💎rewards-discussion](https://discord.com/channels/866376531995918346/969652807940603904) and tag [@Game Keeper]({{ '/guides/game-keeper.html' | relative_url }}) for approval; [@Tracker Helper]({{ '/guides/helpers.html' | relative_url }}) will update the tracker after approval

Early Leavers:
- If a player must leave early but contributed significantly, use the “Early Leavers” checkbox in the sheet and explain in Reason
- Mark which encounters each party member attended; Early Leavers don’t receive item rewards but can receive gold and XP for participated encounters
- Adjust encounter difficulty going forward if needed; ask Game Keepers/Mods for help

Varied Item Rewards:
- For higher-level tables, you may offer options across different rarity tiers (per the sheet’s gold equivalence)
- Offer the same tiers to all players; remind them they can replace an existing item in that tier if duplicates aren’t allowed

DM Rewards:
- You may take DM rewards equal to players’ XP and gold, if you wish

### 8) DM responsibilities (pace, communication, autonomy)

- Pacing & communication: baseline is 1 post/day out of initiative, and 1 post/12 hours in combat; align expectations in your sesh post and at the table, and keep the group accountable; ask [@Game Keeper]({{ '/guides/game-keeper.html' | relative_url }}) or [@Mods]({{ '/guides/moderation.html' | relative_url }}) if pacing/ghosting issues arise
- Character autonomy: don’t dictate player character knowledge or actions; check in before assuming familiarity or feelings; address metagaming directly or via staff
- Game runtime: if a game exceeds the expected timeframe, communicate and adjust; long‑form games should aim for a concrete end date (e.g., “10 weeks”), and shouldn’t pass 60 days beyond that—cut, reorganize, and conclude when needed
