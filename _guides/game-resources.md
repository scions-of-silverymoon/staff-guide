# Game Resources

An on-server reference for Dungeon Masters: encounter types, reward calculators, recommended tools for maps and hosting, and planning aids.

![Encounter flowchart](/assets/images/encounter-flowchart.png)

## Encounters — overview

There are three main encounter types that can generate rewards:

1. Combat — XP comes from monster stat blocks. Use an encounter builder to balance fights for party level.
2. Non-Combat — situations (puzzles, mystery, traps, social, exploration) that involve multiple checks and meaningful failure states.
3. Roleplay — no mechanical failure; reward strong roleplay and table engagement.

Use these categories when estimating encounter difficulty and when preparing submissions to the Game Reserve.

## Encounter calculator & Game Rewards

Silverymoon maintains shared Google Sheets that help calculate XP, gold, and item eligibility. Use the Calculator tab in a copy of the master sheet to compute rewards automatically and then post the link in [💎rewards-discussion](https://discord.com/channels/866376531995918346/969652807940603904) for review.

- [Silverymoon Magic Items List](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bxM3VotDI2CsWw0VAckQhuMeFp59DMJ1PU3yuPyLBMw/edit)

### Quick decision flow

Refer to the flowchart at the top of this page for a quick guide to which encounter type to use when planning rewards.

## Combat encounters — balancing and builders

Combat encounters should be balanced for the expected party level. Use an encounter builder to estimate difficulty and XP. Recommended builders:

- [5e Tools Encounter Builder](https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#aa) — extensive bestiary and encounter tools
- [D&D Beyond Encounter tools](https://www.dndbeyond.com/my-encounters) — build encounters with accessible statblocks

If you need help balancing an encounter, ask in [🏹game-discussion](https://discord.com/channels/866376531995918346/922250381197717555).

## Calculating game rewards

Games provide XP, gold, and sometimes items. The Game Rewards sheet can calculate XP and gold automatically. DMs receive the same XP/gold as players (subject to economy adjustments).

If not using the calculator: add totals for all rewardable situations, then divide by number of players to determine per-player amounts.

Notes about items and consumables are covered in the Magic Item List (link above). Always cross-reference the Silverymoon Tracker before awarding items.

## Maps & hosting

Maps help players visualize combat and are recommended for tactical encounters. Options for acquiring and hosting maps:

1. Find free maps — search for "battle map" + setting (river, forest, etc). Useful sources: [Dice Grimorium](https://dicegrimorium.com/) and [2 Minute Tabletop](https://2minutetabletop.com/)
2. Make your own — see map tools and software: [DND Compendium — maps & tools](https://www.dnd-compendium.com/dm-resources/maps-map-tools)

Hosting options (recommended order):

- [Owlbear Rodeo](https://www.owlbear.rodeo/) (free, user-friendly; not always mobile-friendly)
- [Avrae Maps](http://docs.otfbm.com/#/) (internal Avrae map service; mobile-friendly and integrates with Avrae combat)
- [Roll20](https://roll20.net/) (external VTT with extensive features)
- [Foundry VTT](https://foundryvtt.com/) (paid, powerful, highly customizable)

Each hosting path has tradeoffs — see the pros/cons in the DM planning notes and choose what fits your game and player base.
