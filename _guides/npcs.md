## NPC Guide

NPCs make Silverymoon feel alive and like a living breathing city. Having recurring NPCs that the characters and players can connect to adds another level to our storytelling.

### The Basics

1. Existing NPCs and who can use them.
2. How to play an NPC and what you can do with them.
3. How to make your own NPC.
4. Magic items purchasing and NPC XP timer.

### 1. Existing NPCs and Who Can Use Them

Major NPCs are listed in [#npc-profiles](https://discord.com/channels/866376531995918346/866474915523985428) as it has all the information about them you could possibly need in there. They are also listed in [#npc-directory](https://discord.com/channels/866376531995918346/966429991707488346) so that the players know which NPCs are available too. If you wish to use a staff-made minor NPC, ping @Moderation in [#staff-chat](https://discord.com/channels/866376531995918346/922250246761885696) if you would like to use one of them in your game!

**Who can use them?**

@NPC Staff, @DMs, @Game Keeper, and @Event Planners.

For those with the @NPC Staff role, you can use any NPC that you may need for any quest or RPing needs. For DMs, you can also utilize any NPC that you need, including making your own.

For minor NPCs, use the narrator role using `.use narrator` instead of using their own profile.

### 2. How to Play an NPC and What You Can Do With Them

You can use an NPC in the following ways:

1. Members can request to RP with an NPC using [#looking-for-rp](https://discord.com/channels/866376531995918346/911867303283544094), be it a preexisting one or a new requested one.
2. During server events and festivals.
3. While DMing.
4. When requested for item purchases (Note: NPCs are not required for purchases).

**How to Play an NPC**

**IMPORTANT** - Limit yourself! No more than 2 NPC scenes at a time to avoid burnout.

1. There should be a practical purpose behind the scene, i.e., a question or purchase. NPCs are not just characters to hang out with.
2. PCs should not rely on NPCs for major story beats or otherwise, so the scene should not set up a recurring need.
3. There needs to be a goal for the NPC scene. What is the PC hoping to accomplish?

When it comes to writing the NPC, have a look at their profile in [#npc-profiles](https://discord.com/channels/866376531995918346/866474915523985428) and read through some of the previous scenes that NPC has been in to get the general vibe. Try and stick to the characteristics shown, but of course, we understand that not everyone will play them the same and that's ok! If you're struggling, you can always ask about the NPC in [#staff-chat](https://discord.com/channels/866376531995918346/922250246761885696) for a helping hand.

**The Technical Bits**

We use @Rodbot `.` rodbot for our NPCs. The commands to utilize are in [#rodbot-commands](https://discord.com/channels/866376531995918346/866471337563258880), but mostly you'll be using `.use name text` and `.edit name edited text`.

### 3. How to Make Your Own NPC

If the current NPCs in [#npc-directory](https://discord.com/channels/866376531995918346/966429991707488346) or the Silverymoon tracker don't suit your or the players' needs, we can make a new one! DMs or NPC players are free to request a new NPC, though if it's just a minor non-recurring NPC please just use the narrator!

1. Give @Moderation a ping in [#staff-chat](https://discord.com/channels/866376531995918346/922250246761885696) and explain why you're creating a new NPC and why.
2. You need to give us a picture, a name, and a general personality for your new NPC. Post these in [#npc-tester](https://discord.com/channels/866376531995918346/983597539007819776) and ping @Game Keeper.
3. Mods will enter this into [#npc-permissions](https://discord.com/channels/866376531995918346/866495708734816286) and very soon you will have your new NPC!
4. Make sure to enter all the new NPC information in the tracker [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xFy3p0I21BbkOJqiBZ3R3GVW8d_GHAoRMgSim2ICw3c/edit?gid=1696200230#gid=1696200230).
5. And add them to [#npc-profiles](https://discord.com/channels/866376531995918346/866474915523985428).

### 4. Magic Item Purchasing with an NPC

1. Before you accept the RP scene for this purchase, find out what item(s) are going to be bought and what the price of these items are. There are a couple of different RP channels and NPCs depending on what the item is.

   - [#shining-scroll](https://discord.com/channels/866376531995918346/880874392316420117) - is for, as the name suggests, magic scrolls, potions, poisons, and spell components.
   - [#optyms-blade-shop-and-smithy](https://discord.com/channels/866376531995918346/880897412401627166) - is for mundane armor and weapons and adding enchantments to them.
   - [#the-wyrmworks](https://discord.com/channels/866376531995918346/885377822426791966) - everything else.

   Only common and uncommon items are available to be purchased. These do not *require* an NPC. Anything of a higher rarity is only available via game rewards. The list of purchasable items is [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1F8DvlU33uioFI4h-_dkiPXlt5hIUBESr/view).

2. When the RP is almost done, provide the player the commands and ask them to use them in [#xp-and-gold-logs](https://discord.com/channels/866376531995918346/866544082331369472) and to track them in [#transaction-log](https://discord.com/channels/866376531995918346/881217696023326720) making sure to ping @Trackers.

3. After the purchase is complete, trackers will log that purchase in the character tracker!

### NPC RP Timer

NPC RP timer can be utilized to keep track of how many staff points you're owed for your NPC scenes. Run this in [#staff-point-log](https://discord.com/channels/866376531995918346/882728089367478342).

It functions almost identically to the standard RP timer, except it will log staff points (1 per hour) instead of RPXP. To use it, your commands are:

- `!npcrp` - check timer
- `!npcrp start` - start NPCing
- `!npcrp pause` - pause NPCing
- `!npcrp end` - log time into staff points
- `!npcrp ?` - help guide for NPC RP

Remember! Make sure your ending total is at least 2 pts for every NPC scene! *(i.e. 1 hour of NPCing will be 1pt, you manually add your `!staff 1 NPCing Xara for Mimi` on top of it)*
