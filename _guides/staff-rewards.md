# Staff Rewards

Staff can be rewarded for all the amazing things they do. Staff rewards are tracked as points and banked into XP weekly when running lifestyle.

- Conversion: 1 staff point = 15 XP × character proficiency bonus
- Subject to change: Point values may be adjusted over time to keep level growth fair across staff and players.

## Notes

- Multiple roles: Staff may choose to take on multiple roles to broaden opportunities for rewards.
- Availability points: If multiple roles grant availability-based points, they don’t stack; the highest applicable availability amount is rewarded.
- Fair play: Restrictions are in place to ensure staff don’t drastically surpass the server’s average levels. We aim for fairness for everyone.

Plenty of opportunities to grow and gain rewards by helping the server. ❤️
