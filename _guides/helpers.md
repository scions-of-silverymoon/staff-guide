# Helpers

Helpers are the most active, front-line staff. They welcome new players, answer basic questions, and guide members to the correct channels or staff when needed.

Common responsibilities

- Welcome new players and assist with initial setup.
- Answer common questions and offer quick help.
- Route questions or issues to the right staff role (e.g., Mods, DMs, Game Keeper).
- Keep an eye on RP activity and signal any concerns to Mods.

Best practices

- Be friendly and patient. Assume good intent.
- If something looks like a rule issue, escalate to Mods rather than handling it alone.
- Use the helper-specific resources (e.g., helper-overview channel) for role-specific procedures.

Notes

- Helpers often track activity and coordinate with Mods about member engagement and LFRP pings.

## Helper tools and routine

This section is a condensed checklist from the Helper Overview channel and covers common workflows.

### Guiding new players

- Welcome players into the server in [🌜welcome🌛](https://discord.com/channels/866376531995918346/866401719189897236).
- Add them to the sheet as soon as they join the server, with a ping date for 1 week after they join and the status "Brand New". This date is their character creation limit; when it comes up, check whether they've submitted a character and track progress.
- Help new players follow the steps in [🧭membership-guide](https://discord.com/channels/866376531995918346/885009587500101732).
- Check sheet submissions via the guide in [✅sheet-checking](https://discord.com/channels/866376531995918346/966900730399182858).
- Add and transfer characters in Silverymoon Player Tracker, or tag a [@Tracker Keeper]({{ '/guides/helpers.html' | relative_url }}) for assistance.
- Once they have a character and are approved, change their status to "New Joiner" and set a ping date for 1 month after their profile was posted. This is their check-in for seeing if they've roleplayed yet.

> Note: After claiming a sheet (see [✅sheet-checking]), you become the Helper Buddy for that player — introduce yourself by name and support them through setup and questions.

### Where to look for questions

- Field general questions and route the player to rules or official sources in [❓questions-for-the-staff👋](https://discord.com/channels/866376531995918346/866503846204276746) when needed. For quick visibility, also monitor [🎡general-chat](https://discord.com/channels/866376531995918346/866376531995918349) and [👅out-of-character](https://discord.com/channels/866376531995918346/880924497711091744).
- Use [🚩troubleshooting-help](https://discord.com/channels/866376531995918346/885617429265383424) for technical or account issues; tag Mods if a rule or enforcement question arises.

### Cleaning up departed players

- When a player leaves, remove their associated posts in [🧚character-profile🧛🏻](https://discord.com/channels/866376531995918346/866543876294180904) and [🙋player-profile](https://discord.com/channels/866376531995918346/966837557000274010), and clear reactions in [🧮player-roles](https://discord.com/channels/866376531995918346/881205108329807962).
- If this is a larger sweep or needs assistance, tag a [@Tracker Keeper]({{ '/guides/helpers.html' | relative_url }}) to coordinate. [@Wish Keepers]({{ '/guides/wish-system.html' | relative_url }}) handle wish-queue sweep actions in [📬wish-vault](https://discord.com/channels/866376531995918346/1088099880318279740) and [🎎little-wishes](https://discord.com/channels/866376531995918346/1088099833472106547).

### Weekly & monthly checks (report cadence)

- Report weekly on Sunday to [📝community-guidelines](https://discord.com/channels/866376531995918346/866406430558257163) — see the Helper Overview channel for the exact template.
- Ping players approaching the 1-week character creation limit in [🤷🏿character-discussion](https://discord.com/channels/866376531995918346/866543836804677682).
- Reach out to players whose posts in [👀looking-for-rp](https://discord.com/channels/866376531995918346/911867303283544094) have been up longer than 4 days.
- Ensure transactions approved in [🧾transaction-log](https://discord.com/channels/866376531995918346/881217696023326720) match activity in [💰xp-and-gold-logs](https://discord.com/channels/866376531995918346/866544082331369472), and validate trades in [✨trading-post](https://discord.com/channels/866376531995918346/1034216268867326032).

### Distribution of responsibilities

Helpers may rotate these tasks across the team to balance load: the goal is shared knowledge and redundancy so anyone can step in when needed.

# Barry The Helper Helper

Our tame bot Barry has a few helper specific commands which can streamline common Helper tasks.
In [Staff-Bot-Spam](https://discord.com/channels/866376531995918346/895125956241555486), try the following commands:
```
/useractivity
```
To see a summary of recent user activity - who is RPing and who isn't, and any character level-ups that have happened recently.

```
/channelactivity
```
To see a highlight of any channels with active roleplay scenes that seem to have stalled, and a copy-pastable nudge message for the [Out-of-Character](https://discord.com/channels/866376531995918346/880924497711091744) channel.
