# Helpers

Helpers are the most active, front-line staff. They welcome new players, answer basic questions, and guide members to the correct channels or staff when needed.

Common responsibilities

- Welcome new players and assist with initial setup.
- Answer common questions and offer quick help.
- Route questions or issues to the right staff role (e.g., Mods, DMs, Game Keeper).
- Keep an eye on RP activity and signal any concerns to Mods.

Best practices

- Be friendly and patient. Assume good intent.
- If something looks like a rule issue, escalate to Mods rather than handling it alone.
- Use the helper-specific resources (e.g., helper-overview channel) for role-specific procedures.

Notes

- Helpers often track activity and coordinate with Mods about member engagement and LFRP pings.
