- Wish Keepers: manage the wishlist queue and assign staff to run Wish Quests.

Responsibilities

- Wish DMs: run Wish games, coordinate with players, and deliver requested content when possible.
- Wish Keepers: gather wish details, maintain the queue, and assign staff to execute wishes.

Notes

- Wish Keepers should maintain the wishlist queue in the Tracker and on-server.
