# Moderation & Admins

Moderators (Mods) enforce server rules and manage most moderation tasks. Admins handle server settings, higher-level decisions, and escalations.

What Mods do

- Monitor chat and enforce rules.
- Give warnings, timeouts, and handle quick moderation actions.
- Escalate repeated or serious incidents to Admins.

What Admins do

- Manage server settings and major rule decisions.
- Review escalated moderation cases and decide on permanent actions.
- Assign roles and ensure staff policies are followed.

If you are unsure who to contact, ping `@Mods` in staff channels for moderation help.
